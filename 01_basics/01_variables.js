const accountId = 21007 //cannot be changed
let accountEmail = "mohan@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "123"
accountCity="hyderabad"//not a good practice

console.log(accountEmail);

console.table([accountEmail,accountId])

//diff between var and let, we only use let because we can avoid scope issue

/*  dont use var */
