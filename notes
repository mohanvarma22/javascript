// js => single threaded, synchronous code

// '''blocking code ex: if you want to access a file then you 
// have to let the kernel t0 read a file and get back to you until then you have to wait  , non blocking code'''

//non blocking code has many disadvantages for an example if nuv oka database ni read chesaka you can verify that if  the user is already registered or not
// so in some cases you needing blocking code

// js engine lo only memory heap and call stack untay which is single threaded in nature
// manam vade browser lo kani node js lo kani js engine mathrame undavu we also have web api and task queue along 
//ee mudu oka event loop lo untay

//js engine lo suppose set timer call chesam anuko aa set timeer anedi 
// web api lo untundi akkada call ayiddi aa pani aypoyaka then
// it gets sent to task queue fifo lo it will be sent back to js engine call stack
